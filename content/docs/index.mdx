description: A minimal AI translator supporting OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / Ollama.
---

MinTranslate is a minimal AI translator with a **bring-your-own-model** workflow: you configure a provider (API key or local Ollama), and MinTranslate focuses on a clean translation experience.

## Quick start

1. Open `Settings` (`/settings`) and add a Provider (OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / Ollama).
2. Set it as the default Provider.
3. Go back to Home, paste text on the left, and get the translation on the right.

Read the step-by-step guide: [Getting Started](./getting-started)

## What you can do

- **Multiple providers**: Add multiple Providers and switch the default anytime.  
  See: [Providers](./providers)
- **Customize system prompt**: Control tone, formatting, terminology rules.  
  See: [System Prompt](./guides/system-prompt)
- **Local translation history**: Saved in your browser; export as JSON.  
  See: [History & Export](./guides/history-and-export)

## Privacy & storage (high level)

- Translation requests are sent from **your browser** to the Provider you configured.
- Provider config + system prompt are stored in `localStorage`; translation history is stored in `IndexedDB`.
