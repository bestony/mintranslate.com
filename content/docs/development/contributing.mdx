---

This page helps you get a local dev environment running and explains how to contribute to MinTranslate.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed
- A modern browser (for UI testing)

## Local setup

```bash
# 1) Clone
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-dir>

# 2) Install deps
bun install

# 3) Start dev server
bun run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Useful scripts

- `bun run dev`: start Vite dev server (port `3000`)
- `bun run build`: production build
- `bun run preview`: preview production build locally
- `bun run test`: run Vitest
- `bun run lint` / `bun run format` / `bun run check`: Biome lint/format/check

## Project structure (quick map)

- `src/`: application code (React + TanStack Router/Start)
	- `src/routes/`: file-based routes (UI routes and server handlers in `src/routes/api/`)
	- `src/components/`: shared UI components (`src/components/ui/` contains UI primitives)
	- `src/stores/`: client state (TanStack Store)
	- `src/db/`: local persistence (TanStack React DB / localStorage)
	- `src/locales/`: i18n dictionaries (e.g. `en.ts`, `zh.ts`)
	- `src/lib/`: utilities and helpers
- `content/docs/`: documentation (MDX, Fumadocs)
- `public/`: static assets

Generated/ignored (don’t commit): `.tanstack/`, `.output/`, `.source/`, `dist/`

## Code style & conventions

- TypeScript is `strict`: avoid `any` and keep types explicit at module boundaries.
- Biome is the source of truth for formatting (tabs + double quotes).
- Prefer path-alias imports: `@/…` maps to `src/…`.
- Don’t edit generated files (notably `src/routeTree.gen.ts`).

## Working on docs

- Docs live in `content/docs/` as `*.mdx`.
- Most pages have both English and Chinese versions: `page.mdx` and `page.zh.mdx`.
	- If you update one, please update the other, keeping structure and links in sync.

## Security / privacy notes for contributors

- Never commit API keys or secrets.
- Provider keys are configured in-app and stored in browser `localStorage` (local to your browser/device).

## Submitting changes

Recommended workflow:

1. Create a new branch for your change.
2. Keep changes small and focused.
3. Run `bun run test` and (if relevant) `bun run build`.
4. Open a PR with:
	- a short description
	- steps to verify (e.g. `bun run dev`)
	- screenshots for UI changes
