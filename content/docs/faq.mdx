## Why doesn’t translation start?

Most commonly:

- You haven’t configured a **default Provider**
- The default Provider is missing an **API key** (cloud providers)
- The input is empty or whitespace

Go to `/settings`, add a Provider, and set it as default.

## What languages are supported?

Currently: **Chinese ↔ English** only.

## How do I translate immediately?

- Click **Translate now**
- Shortcut: `⌘ + Enter` / `Ctrl + Enter`

## Where is my API key stored?

In your browser localStorage under `mintranslate.aiProviders`.

See: [Privacy & Storage](./guides/privacy-and-storage)

## Ollama can’t connect

Check:

- Ollama is running
- Host is correct (default `http://localhost:11434`)
- The model exists (run `ollama pull <model>`)

## Can I sync settings/history across devices?

Not built-in. You can export history as JSON, but importing isn’t supported yet.
