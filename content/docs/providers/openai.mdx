description: Configure OpenAI (or an OpenAI-compatible endpoint) in MinTranslate.
---

## When to use

- You already have an OpenAI API key
- You want to use an OpenAI-compatible Base URL (optional)

## Fields in MinTranslate

- **Name**: for your own reference
- **Model**: the model name you want to call
- **API Key**: required
- **Base URL** (optional): leave empty to use the default

Example model names you can start with:

- `gpt-4.1-mini` (default in this project)

## Tips

- Treat API keys as secrets; MinTranslate stores them in browser localStorage.
- If requests fail, double check the model name and Base URL.

## Troubleshooting

- **“OpenAI API key is not configured”**: you haven’t saved an API key for the default provider.
- **Request failed**: verify your key, model, and network; if you set a Base URL, make sure it’s correct and reachable.
