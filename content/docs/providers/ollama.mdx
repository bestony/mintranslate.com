title: Ollama
description: Use a local model with Ollama (no API key required).
---

## When to use

- You want local-first translation
- You don’t want to store a cloud API key in the browser

## Prerequisites

1. Install and run Ollama on your machine
2. Pull a model, for example:

```bash
ollama pull llama3
```

## Fields in MinTranslate

- **Name**
- **Model**: for example `llama3`
- **Ollama Host** (optional): defaults to `http://localhost:11434`

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection refused / timeout**: make sure Ollama is running and the host is correct.
- **Model not found**: pull the model first with `ollama pull ...`.
