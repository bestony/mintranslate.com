## 1) Add a Provider

1. Open the Settings page: `/settings`
2. In **AI Providers**, click **Add**
3. Choose a provider type and fill in:
   - **Name**: anything you like
   - **Model**: the model name you want to use
   - **API Key** (for OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini)
   - **Ollama Host** (optional, for Ollama; default is `http://localhost:11434`)
4. Save, then set it as the **Default** provider

Provider details: [Providers](./providers)

## 2) Translate

Go back to Home and paste text on the left.
