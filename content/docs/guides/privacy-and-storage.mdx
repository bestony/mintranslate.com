## Data flow (translation)

MinTranslate sends translation requests from **your browser** to the Provider you configured.

What is typically included:

- The text you entered
- The system prompt you set
- The translation direction (Chinese ↔ English)

> Note: MinTranslate does not proxy your translation content or store translation text on a server.

## What is stored locally

MinTranslate uses browser storage (`localStorage`) for configuration and history. This data is local to your current browser/device and is not automatically synced across devices.

Common keys:

- `mintranslate.aiProviders`: all provider configs (including API keys)
- `mintranslate.aiDefaultProviderId`: the default provider id
- `mintranslate.appSettings`: app settings such as system prompt
- `mintranslate.translateHistory`: translation history items
- `mintranslate.uiLanguage`: UI language preference

## How to clear

Options:

- Delete providers in `/settings` (local only)
- Clear translation history in `/history`
- Use your browser’s “Clear site data” to remove everything

## Security tips

- Avoid configuring cloud provider API keys on shared/public computers.
- For sensitive content, consider using a separate browser profile.
- For local-only workflows, consider using Ollama (local models).
