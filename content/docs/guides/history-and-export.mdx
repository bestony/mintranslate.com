title: History & Export
description: View local translation history, export as JSON, and clear data.
---

MinTranslate stores translation history **locally in your browser** (`IndexedDB`).

> Older versions stored history in `localStorage` under `mintranslate.translateHistory`. New versions store history in `IndexedDB` and clear that legacy key automatically (no migration).

## Where to view

- Home shows a small “recent history” section
- Full history page: `/history`

## When items are saved

History is written after a translation succeeds.

## Export as JSON

On `/history`, click **Export JSON** to download a file containing all records.

Record shape:

```json
{
  "id": "…",
  "createdAt": 1730000000000,
  "sourceLang": "zh",
  "targetLang": "en",
  "sourceText": "…",
  "translatedText": "…"
}
```

## Clear history

You can clear history from `/history`. This only affects local data in your current browser.
